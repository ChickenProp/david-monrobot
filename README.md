Reflective Equilibrium Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament
-------------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE: This repo is a work-in-progress for now, and the tournament is not yet
open. Please check back soon.**

This repo contains the source code for an iterated prisoner's dilemma
tournament that will be open to the public in the near future. In this
tournament, competitors will submit Haskell bots that play the iterated
prisoner's dilemma against other bots. However, not only are bots allowed to
view the outcomes of previous rounds of the prisoner's dilemma, they also have
the ability to run the bot they are playing against, effectively granting them
to perfectly simulate their opponent before making their move.

Check out the `Bots.hs` file for some sample bots, and run the file for an
example 10-round tournament.

Issues/pull requests are always appreciated.
